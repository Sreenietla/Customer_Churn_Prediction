# Customer_Churn_Prediction
To predict the telecom customers who are likely to exit the contract and also to generate patterns of Churn and non-churn to assist the management to take appropriate decisions to limit churn

A major telecom company in India has a business problem with customer
retention. The company observed that alarming number of customers exit when
their contracts expire while it is getting increasingly difficult to acquire new
customers.
It is a market reality that Telecom companies are battling to attract each other's
customers while retaining their own. Thus, Customer churn reduction is the
central concern of most telecom companies as switching costs to the customer
are low and acquisition cost to the company is high. Churn reduces profitability
as it means potential loss of future revenue and also losing the invested costs of
acquisition. So a good deal of marketing budget is allocated to prevent churn by
designing new plans and discounts etc. But they want to understand the hidden
patterns in the customer behaviour by use of customer behavioural data which
lead to construction of purchase decision and also the underlying loyalty hooks.
Beyond building a model to predict churn you will have to identify the patterns
for churn and non-churn also which will help in-turn to the company to take
action accordingly to limit churn.
